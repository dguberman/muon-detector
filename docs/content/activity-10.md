## Day 1 ##
- Introduction (oral presentation)
What are cosmic rays? What are muons? How can we detect them?
Basics of our detector (SiPM, scintillator, basic electronics)

- Hands-on: Build the readout board for the SiPM and the power supply. Test de conections using a tester.
Needed: Soldering station, soldering wire, tester, "placa de topos", resistors, capacitors, sockets (see materials...)

## Day 2-3 ##
- Finish the construction of the boards. Test them using a light source. What do we see? What is the minimum amplitude we can observe?
Needed: LED Driver, Power supply (20V), Pulse Generator, oscilloscope, wires and conectors, black box

- Test the amplifier circuit using a pulse generator and a probe. Using a square signal see how it changes from the input to the output of the amplifier. See how it changes as the frequency increases. What is the gain of the amplifier?
Needed: Power supply 5V (x2)

- Now connect the SiPM board to the amplifier. What is the gain? Observe some pulses, what is the minimum signal we can observe? can we see the single photoelectron? How does a SiPM work, then?
Switch off the LED. What do we see? How should we set the trigger to avoid fake triggers from dark counts?

## Day 4-5 ##
- Add the scintillator. See now the pulses in the box

- Cover the scintilator in teflon and black tape. Can we see the pulses from the LED now? What do we see?
Needed: Teflon tape, reflective foil, black tape.

- Put the detector in a light-tight box. What do we see? What is the rate of events
Needed: light-tight case for the detector (x2)

## Day 6 ##
- Measurements, coincidence and showers

## Day 7 ##
- Measurements (cont.)
- Closing (slides)
