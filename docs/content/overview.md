- [Install Hugo](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) and create a new site.
- Install hugo simpledoc theme. Inside your new Hugo project run:

```
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/aerohub/hugo-simpledoc-theme
```

Then take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/aerohub/hugo-simpledoc-theme/tree/master/exampleSite) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called `config.toml` and a folder `archetypes`. Copy them into the root folder of your Hugo site.

## Configuration

Open just-copied `config.toml` and fill it with your data. Pay attention on top menu items.

Now you are ready to create your documentation.
