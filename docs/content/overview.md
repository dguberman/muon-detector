## Introduction
The project is about developing a Muon Detector that anybody can build and **learn about experimental physics, electronics, detector technology and astrophysics** in the process. Activities to guide students in the process of understanding, building and using the detectors in experiments will be developed as part of the project.

## Objectives
- To develop a **simple muon detector based on SiPM** for outreach and educational activities.
- To develop a set of **outreach & educational activities** related to assembling, testing and using these detectors.
- To raise awareness about experimental physics, detector technology and high energy astrophysics.

## The Detector
- The muon detectors will be **affordable**, **portable** and **easy to assemble**.
- Muon detection is based on **SciPM** and **plastic scintillator**. **Adhoc electronics** and **Arduino** are use for signal processing. A display will be used as event counter and LEDs as event display.
- Intermediate prototypes will have some but not all of these features.

  > **The detector is not a black box.** Users will have to interact with several parameters, such as voltage supplied to the SIPM. This is part of the process of understanding what this kind of particle detection is about.

## The Activities
- **Assembly and testing activities** are designed as step-by-step procedures to not only build the detector but also to understand the physics behind the detector.
- The detectors will be used in different setups in order to perform **astrophysics experiments**. Only a deep understanding of the detector will make these experiments meaningful.
- Other more **high-level activities** will be developed.

## Uses
- BIYSC
- Treballs de Recerca by High-School Students
- Collaboration with FabLabs
- Science Fairs Workshops
- Citizen Science projects
- Outreach projects integrated in the City
